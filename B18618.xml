            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The CASE OF Sir <hi>FRANCIS FANE</hi> The Younger.</head>
            <p>FIRST, The Bill ſetteth forth, that upon his Marriage be ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled the Mannor of <hi>Firbeck,</hi> and Lands thereunto belonging, lying in the County of <hi>York,</hi> upon ſeveral Truſtees, to the uſe of himſelf for Life; the Remainder to <hi>Hannah</hi> his Wife for her Joynture; the Remainder to the Heirs Males of the Body of the ſaid Sir <hi>Francis Fane</hi> on the Body of the ſaid <hi>Hannah</hi> his Wife, the Remainder to the Right Heirs of Sir <hi>Francis Fane</hi> in Fee; ſo there is no other Remainder limited in the ſaid conveyance, which might be cut off, if Sir <hi>Francis</hi> and his Wife, and the Truſtees had joyned, they might have made a good Eſtate, without an Act of Parliament.</p>
            <p>But there being a Leaſe for ninety nine years, of the ſame Mannor, and Lands to other Truſtees, for a Proviſion for Daughters Portions begotten by Sir <hi>Francis</hi> on the Body of his ſaid Wife, in caſe there were no Heirs Males: If the ſaid Truſtees had ſuffered a Recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of this Eſtate, and the effect of the firſt Conveyance ceaſing, would have come in upon them, and veſted in Intereſt; ſo that this Leaſe without an Act of Parliament cannot be unſettled; nor can any good Eſtate be made, to a Purchaſer. The Act further ſets forth, that there being ſome incumbrances upon the ſaid Mannor of <hi>Firbeck,</hi> undiſcharged before the ſaid ſettlement: and that he the ſaid Sir <hi>Francis</hi> hath contracted ſome Debts ſince, is deſirous that the ſaid Debts might be paid, and Incumbrances diſcharged: But having no other Lands which he can expoſe to ſale, which will be ſold at ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ood a rate, as the ſaid Mannor of <hi>Firbeck,</hi> The ſaid Sir <hi>Francis</hi> hath prevailed with <hi>John Ruſhworth</hi> Father of the ſaid <hi>Hannah,</hi> and with the Truſtees to conſent to the ſale thereof; provided always, that the ſaid Sir <hi>Francis</hi> do ſettle an Eſtate equivalent, to the value of the ſaid Mannor and Premiſſes.</p>
            <p>And it is particularly expreſſed in the ſaid Act, what Eſtate the ſaid Sir <hi>Francis</hi> doth ſettle, in lieu of the ſaid Mannor, as a Proviſion for a Joynture for his ſaid Wife, for the good of the Heirs Males, and for Daughters Portions in caſe of no Heirs Males; and hath (by Deed in Writing under his Hand and Seal) ſettled that Eſtate accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly in caſe it pleaſe the Parliament to paſs this Act; wherein the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of all parties doth concur accordingly.</p>
